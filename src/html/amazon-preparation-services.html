              <h1>Amazon Preparation Services</h1>
              <p>Fulfillment by Amazon, FBA, remains one of the best ways to put your inventory in front of American shoppers even if you are located internationally. It takes advantage of the impressive infrastructure and reputation Amazon have built, from Prime membership with free delivery to the secure payment system trusted by millions. However, for all the benefits, FBA does have problems too, mostly caused by a lack of flexibility. FBA requires that products are ready to be shipped upon arrival at the fulfillment center, and if you fail to do this, they can fine you for non-compliance or even refuse to accept your inventory.</p>

In this situation crossdocking, the practice of unloading containers directly to outbound carriers and avoiding storage fees, has become more common. We can provide extensive crossdocking solutions, including relabeling during redistribution and shipping to multiple destinations immediately after unloading. Consolidation solutions ensure you benefit from the best shipping discounts available, streamlining the entire shipping process while reducing overheads.</p>
