              <p>Amazon has risen to become one of the most trusted ecommerce sites around, and it has become incredibly popular around  the world. By selling through Amazon, international retailers and individuals have effective, easy access to millions of American shoppers without the infrastructure and marketing costs otherwise needed. However, Amazon also has stringent standards for customer satisfaction, and that means effective return policies to a U.S based address or free return shipping to overseas addresses, which can be a challenge for international sellers. With shipping delays and additional costs, your customers can become frustrated with the customer experience and lead to feedback problems with Amazon.</p>

              <p>To avoid that, having a local U.S. based return address makes all the difference. We can help you with this by offering international merchants a U.S. address for returns. Upon arrival each return is scanned, and your account automatically updated with the important information such as tracking details, size and weight along with details of the returned contents. Along with this, we also provide the prepaid return shipping labels that ensure the highest standards of service for those American shoppers, keeping them happy and your feedback positive.</p>
